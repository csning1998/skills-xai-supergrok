# Inspect GitLab MRs

Layer for delivery read on GitLab.

## When to Use

The owner asked to list or inspect merge requests.

## Input Requirements

- Required: group or `owner/repo` from the owner in this turn.

## Process

1. If the target is missing, ask for it.
2. Fill module JSON and call `~/.grok/skills/skill-module-inspect-gitlab-mrs/SKILL.md`.

```json
{
    "target_type": "repo",
    "target": "owner/repo",
    "state": "merged"
}
```

`state` is `merged` unless the owner named another state.

1. When the owner asked for descriptions, fill `summary_paragraph` from each `description`. Take the first paragraph after `## Summary` or `## Description`. If neither heading exists, use the first non-heading paragraph. Normalize `\r\n` to `\n`. Reject a bare heading such as `## Changes`.

## Output

Artifact `GitlabMrList` plus optional `summary_paragraph` on each record.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Timezone conversion was not applied here
- [ ] No Notion page was created

## Backtrack Triggers

- Module `ok` false: report `error` and stop.

## Example

`/skill-inspect-gitlab-mrs` plus a repo path lists merged MRs.
