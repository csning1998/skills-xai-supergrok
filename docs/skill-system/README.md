# Skill system

Agent reads this tree before writing or changing a `skill-*` or `skill-module-*` file.

Second Brain stays in `../second-brain/`. This tree is the skill writing contract. It is not a Notion locate path.

The Input, Output, Validation, and Backtrack section names come from ForceInjection `domain-driven-design-skills` under Apache License 2.0. Source repository: `https://github.com/ForceInjection/domain-driven-design-skills`. Copied English files live in `reference/`. The file map and APA list are in `reference/NOTICE.md`. Layer, module, `/tmp` payload, effort roles, and The Algorithm are owner work.

Do not copy `ddd-scope` through `ddd-openspec-bridge` into `~/.grok/skills/`. Those nine skills are a modeling pipeline. The owner already holds the model in Second Brain.

## Section 2. Interface taken from ForceInjection

A layer `SKILL.md` uses these sections. Source is `reference/docs/ddd-skill-system-design.en.md` section 1.3.

1. When to Use
2. Input Requirements (name the upstream skill that produced each artifact)
3. Process
4. Output (artifact name plus JSON structure)
5. Validation Checklist
6. Backtrack Triggers
7. Example

A later skill consumes a named artifact. It does not reopen an upstream module to recompute a field.

## Section 3. Owner flavor

### Item A. The Algorithm

Apply these five steps in order on every change. Do not skip to a later step.

1. Question every requirement. Name who asked for it in this workspace.
2. Delete any part or step that is not required.
3. Simplify what remains.
4. Accelerate cycle time.
5. Automate last.

A retrospective that lists five next patches has skipped step 2.

### Item B. Layer

A `skill-*` that calls module skills is a layer.

The layer owns variable names, fill rules, and the Notion (or later gRPC) property list. It collects each module JSON and builds the next module input.

Every layer `SKILL.md` MUST set frontmatter `effort` to `low`, `medium`, or `high`. That value is the spawn budget for delegated work. The parent GUI session may stay on high or extra high.

When spawning a child for that skill, map `effort` as follows.

| `effort` | `subagent_type`                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `low`    | `exec-low`                                                   |
| `medium` | `exec-medium`                                                |
| `high`   | `general-purpose` only when the owner asked for a high child |

Do not spawn bare `general-purpose` for `low` or `medium`. That child inherits the parent extra-high budget. If `exec-low` fails a mapped call, respawn once as `exec-medium`.

### Item C. Module

- A module `SKILL.md` MUST set `effort: low`.
- A `skill-module-*` file receives JSON. It maps that JSON onto one tool (yt-dlp, Buzz, Notion MCP, later an HTTP or gRPC client) and returns JSON.
- **A MODULE MUST BE ONLY STATELESS.**
    - It MUST NOT bake collection IDs, group paths, mapping tables, or owner home paths into its contract. Input examples use placeholders the layer replaces.
    - A module MUST NOT decide Title, Author, Published, Description, content, or relation targets.
    - A module MUST NOT read Second Brain to invent fill values.

### Item D. Isolation

If the Notion API changes, only the Notion module changes. yt-dlp and Buzz modules stay untouched.

If the owner later replaces Notion with a self-hosted API, only the write module changes. Layer fill tables stay.

## Section 4. YouTube to Resources handoff

Layer is one `skill-*` that sequences three modules.

1. Layer fills yt-dlp input JSON (`url`, `mode`, `outdir`). Module returns JSON (`media_path`, `watch_url`, tags if present).
2. Layer fills Buzz input JSON (`media_path`, `model_type`, `model_size`, `language`). Module returns JSON (`transcript_path`, `exit_code`).
3. Layer creates `/tmp/skill-youtube-to-resources/<id>/` with mode `0700`, writes `VideoResourcePayload` there, and sends `payload_path` to the Notion module. The module reads that file. Agent MUST NOT paste Title, Description, or content into a tool call.

Do not paste a live title or transcript into a `SKILL.md`.

## Section 5. After every run

After a layer or module run ends, success or fail, Agent MUST publish a retrospective in that turn. A green run still gets the block.

### Item A. Review

1. What ran. Name the layer, the modules, and the `/tmp/...` artifact directory.
2. Facts. Exit codes, CUDA, lookup hit or miss, page url, payload path.
3. Breaks and drift. Only what this run observed.
4. Next patch. Run The Algorithm. One owning file. Delete first.
5. Leave alone. What this run does not rewrite.

Write the review to `/tmp/<layer>/<id>/retrospective.json` when a `/tmp` run directory already exists.

### Item B. Write-back

When a run fails or the owner corrects a boundary, patch the file that owns the field in the same turn. Do not leave the lesson only in chat.

| Failure class      | Owning file                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Wrong fill         | The layer skill                |
| Wrong tool flags   | The module skill               |
| Notion entity rule | `../second-brain/` entity file |
