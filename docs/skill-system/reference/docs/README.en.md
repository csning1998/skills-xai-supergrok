# Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Skill Panorama

> :warning: **Work In Progress (WIP)**: This repository and its in-house backbone are under active construction and continuous iteration. Some structures, documentation, and specifications may change at any time.

This repository centers on self-developed `ddd-*` Skills, providing a domain modeling backbone pipeline for AI Agents (Discovery / Strategic / Tactical / Validation / Specification Bridging). It also documents mainstream DDD-related AI Skills from the ecosystem as research references (see [External Ecosystem References](#external-ecosystem-reference)) for comparison and on-demand use.

## In-House DDD Skills (`ddd-*` Skills)

The core deliverable of this repository is the set of **self-developed `ddd-*` Skills** under the `skills/` directory, forming a domain modeling backbone pipeline for AI Agents. External ecosystem Skills serve only as **research references** (see [External Ecosystem References](#external-ecosystem-reference)) for comparison and on-demand use — they do not carry mainline responsibilities.

### Design Motivation & Boundaries

**Problems to solve**:

- Most DDD Skills in the open-source ecosystem are **single-point capabilities** (e.g., only doing event storming, only doing aggregate code generation), lacking a **complete, loopable pipeline** from problem space discovery -> strategic decomposition -> tactical modeling -> model validation.
- Input/output formats across different Skills are not unified, making it difficult for AI Agents to **chain them** into deliverable modeling artifacts.
- The modeling process is inherently **non-linear**, but most Skills don't provide explicit backtrack trigger conditions, making it impossible to locate the upstream stage that needs correction when issues are found later.

**Goals**:

- Provide standardized Skills covering 5 stages (Discovery / Strategic / Tactical / Validation / Specification Bridging), with each Skill producing **structured artifacts** in a single conversation turn.
- Unify the SKILL.md interface contract (When to Use, Input, Process, Output, Validation Checklist, Backtrack Triggers) to ensure cross-stage artifact compatibility.
- Explicitly define **backtrack trigger conditions** (e.g., invariant expression rate < 60% -> return to `ddd-aggregates`) to support bidirectional closed-loop feedback.
- Support **non-sequential entry**: new projects, existing systems, partial deepening, quality audits, and specification generation can all find an appropriate entry Skill.

**Non-goals**:

- **No direct business code generation** — this repository focuses on domain modeling and engineering specification bridging (OpenSpec); concrete code implementation is left to developers or downstream AI tools.
- **No specific tech stack prescribed** (for Java / Kotlin / Python / .NET implementations, use external ecosystem Skills).

### Skill List (5 Stages / 9 Skills)

| Stage           | Skill                     | Summary                                                                                                               | Optional Enhancement (External)               |
| :-------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| I Discovery     | `ddd-scope`               | Scope convergence: problem statement, goals/non-goals, constraints, terminology seeds, risk inventory                 | `ddd-strategic-design`, `ddd-planning`        |
| I Discovery     | `ddd-discover`            | Collaborative domain discovery: event flows, command/event candidates, hotspots, ambiguity list                       |                                               |
| II Strategic    | `ddd-subdomains`          | Subdomain classification: Core/Supporting/Generic + core domain declaration & ownership recommendations               | `ddd-context-mapping`, `domain-driven-design` |
| II Strategic    | `ddd-contexts`            | Bounded Context design: responsibilities, Ubiquitous Language glossary, boundary ADRs, ownership                      |                                               |
| II Strategic    | `ddd-context-map`         | Context mapping: integration patterns (ACL/OHS/PL etc.), contract ownership, failure modes                            |                                               |
| III Tactical    | `ddd-aggregates`          | Aggregate design: invariants, entities/value objects, transaction boundaries & cross-aggregate consistency strategies | `domain-driven-design`, `clean-ddd-hexagonal` |
| III Tactical    | `ddd-domain-interactions` | Domain interactions: domain event directory, domain services, repository interfaces, factories                        |                                               |
| IV Validation   | `ddd-model-review`        | Model quality assessment: consistency scoring, completeness checks, coupling analysis & backtrack triggers            | `clean-architecture`                          |
| V Specification | `ddd-openspec-bridge`     | Specification bridging: map DDD tactical artifacts to OpenSpec structured specifications                              | `openspec-assistant`                          |

> **Non-linear process**: Bidirectional feedback is supported between stages. Model validation (Stage IV) can trigger backtracking to earlier stages for correction, ultimately exporting through Stage V to engineering specifications. See Appendix B in [ddd-skill-system-design.en.md](docs/ddd-skill-system-design.en.md) for the detailed dependency graph and backtrack trigger matrix.

@ddd-subdomains   <discover artifacts>
...
@ddd-model-review <existing modeling artifacts>
```

## Quality Validation

To perform **objective, repeatable quality assessment** of the in-house `ddd-*` Skill backbone, the repository maintains an independent `validation-cases/` directory containing end-to-end blind-run validation cases and general validation methodology.

- [validation-cases/README.en.md](validation-cases/README.en.md) — **Validation Method Overview**: 6-step process (fuzzy input -> blind-run 8 Skills -> ground truth extraction -> benchmark scoring -> backtrack injection test -> summary report), blind-run constraints, injection matrix, reusable steps, and known limitations.
- [validation-cases/cargo-validation/](validation-cases/cargo-validation/) — **Cargo Validation Case**: Using Eric Evans + Citerus' Cargo Shipping DDD Sample (submodule `validation-cases/cargo-shipping`) as ground truth reference, running the full 8-Skill pipeline. Current weighted score **85.8%** (B+ Good), backtrack trigger tests **5/5 all passed**; see [REPORT.md](validation-cases/cargo-validation/REPORT.md) (in Chinese) for full conclusions.
- [validation-cases/insurance-validation/](validation-cases/insurance-validation/) — **Insurance Underwriting & Claims Validation Case**: a **no-canonical-reference** domain (insurance), scored with the expert-review method (four criteria replacing ground-truth anchors). Weighted score **90.9%** (not directly comparable with the Cargo score); it also appends Stage V (`ddd-openspec-bridge`, OpenSpec changeset 9/9 checklist passed), completing full 5-stage validation; see [REPORT.md](validation-cases/insurance-validation/REPORT.md) (in Chinese) for full conclusions.

Validation results have been fed back into backbone SKILL iterations (e.g., `ddd-aggregates`' "foreign reference re-examination + Specification pattern," `ddd-model-review`'s "industry benchmarking dimension," `ddd-contexts`' "intermediate concept ADR"), forming an observable feedback loop.

## Submodule Management

The repository keeps a single submodule, `validation-cases/cargo-shipping` (the ground-truth source for the validation case). If you've cloned but haven't pulled it:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
