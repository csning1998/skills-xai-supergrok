# DDD In-House Backbone System Design

> 🌐 中文版本: [Chinese](ddd-skill-system-design.md)

The open-source ecosystem provides numerous standalone DDD capabilities, but what AI Agents truly need is a **repeatable, loopable modeling pipeline**: from problem space discovery to strategic decomposition, from tactical modeling to model validation, forming a closed loop. To this end, this repository defines a set of `ddd-*` in-house skills under `skills/` as the system backbone — each skill is a **structured instruction for AI Agents (LLMs)**, executed in a single conversation turn to produce structured artifacts.

**Design boundary**: This system covers **domain modeling** (strategic + tactical) and **implementation specification bridging** (connecting to engineering implementation via OpenSpec). It does not cover concrete code implementation, testing strategy, or architecture compliance checking.

## 1. General Principles & Skill Interface Specification

### 1.1 Five-Stage Model

The system backbone adopts 5 stages, representing **5 different types of modeling work**, not strict linear steps:

| Stage | Name                    | Cognitive Mode           | Key Question                                                                  |
| :---- | :---------------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I     | Problem Space Discovery | Divergent exploration    | What problem are we solving? What happens in the domain?                      |
| II    | Strategic Modeling      | Analytical decomposition | How to partition the domain? Where are the boundaries? How to unify language? |
| III   | Tactical Modeling       | Precise design           | What are the building blocks inside each boundary? How do they collaborate?   |
| IV    | Model Validation        | Critical review          | Is the model consistent, complete, and implementable?                         |
| V     | Specification Bridging  | Transformation mapping   | How to convert the domain model into executable engineering specifications?   |

### 1.2 Non-Linear and Bidirectional Closed Loop

Domain modeling is non-linear (ref. R07). Bidirectional feedback mechanisms exist between stages:

- **Forward progression**: From discovery to validation, ultimately outputting engineering specifications.
- **Backward backtracking**: When later stages discover issues, return to earlier stages for correction based on explicit "trigger-backtrack conditions" (see **Appendix B**).
- **Non-sequential entry**: For existing systems, you can enter from any stage (e.g., starting directly from tactical modeling); you only need to provide the prerequisite context for that stage.

### 1.3 Skill Interface Specification

Each `ddd-*` skill's SKILL.md must include the following structure to ensure AI Agent parseability and executability:

```yaml
---
name: ddd-<skill-name>
description: "<one-line description>"
risk: safe
source: self
tags: "[ddd, <stage>, <focus>]"
date_added: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
---
```

The body must contain the following sections:

| Section                  | Responsibility      | Description                                             |
| :----------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **When to Use**          | Trigger conditions  | When to invoke this skill                               |
| **Input Requirements**   | Prerequisites       | Required and optional inputs; annotate source skill     |
| **Process**              | Execution steps     | AI Agent's operation sequence (5-7 steps)               |
| **Output**               | Deliverable spec    | Table format: artifact name + structure requirements    |
| **Validation Checklist** | Exit gate           | All items must pass before delivery                     |
| **Backtrack Triggers**   | Feedback conditions | Specific conditions triggering return to upstream skill |
| **Example**              | Invocation demo     | Typical usage of `@skill-name`                          |

### 1.4 Non-Sequential Entry

Not all use cases start from Stage I. The system supports the following entry modes:

| Entry Skill        | Applicable Scenario                          | Prerequisites                             |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `ddd-scope`        | New project or vague business needs          | None (entry point)                        |
| `ddd-discover`     | Requirements clear, direct exploration       | User provides scope context               |
| `ddd-contexts`     | Subdomains known, boundaries need refinement | User provides subdomain classification    |
| `ddd-aggregates`   | Single context needs tactical deepening      | User provides context definition          |
| `ddd-model-review` | Existing model needs quality assessment      | User provides existing modeling artifacts |

## 3. Reference Materials & Skill Mapping

To support continuous optimization of the `skills/ddd-*` in-house backbone, this section captures free learning materials from `ddd-crew/free-ddd-learning-resources` as a reusable reference list, mapping each resource to the specific skill and section it can directly strengthen, ensuring changes are traceable, reusable, and iteratively processable.

### 3.1 Reference List (with Metadata)

To ensure the authority and comprehensiveness of theoretical sources, the following list collects classic works, practice guides, and case studies in the DDD domain. These references span strategic design, collaborative modeling, and tactical implementation, forming the knowledge foundation for subsequent backbone optimization.

## Appendix A: Quick Start Example ("Meeting Room Booking System")

This appendix demonstrates the collaboration flow of the 9 backbone skills in a real scenario (this section focuses on the modeling collaboration of Stages I-IV; for Stage V `ddd-openspec-bridge` specification output examples, see [ddd-openspec-mapping.en.md](ddd-openspec-mapping.en.md)).

### A.1 Stage I: Problem Space Discovery

**`ddd-scope` (①)**

- **Input**: Business vision: "We want employees to book available meeting rooms anytime, avoiding time conflicts."
- **Output**:
    - Problem statement: "Meeting room resources lack unified management; frequent time conflicts reduce employee efficiency."
    - Goals: Support time-slot booking, conflict detection, check-in confirmation.
    - Non-goals: Does not cover meeting room equipment maintenance; does not cover video conference scheduling.
    - Constraints: Booking duration must be multiples of 30 minutes; each person can have at most 1 booking per time slot.
    - Terminology seeds: Booking, Room, TimeSlot, CheckIn.
- **Validation Checklist**:
    - [x] Goals and non-goals are mutually exclusive and actionable
    - [x] Constraints are verifiable

**`ddd-discover` (②)**

- **Input**: Scope output from ①.
- **Output (event flow fragment)**:

    | Seq | Event            | Triggering Command | Participant | Exception Path                               |
    | :-- | :--------------- | :----------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------- |
    | 1   | RoomRegistered   | RegisterRoom       | Admin       | —                                            |
    | 2   | BookingRequested | RequestBooking     | Employee    | Time slot full -> BookingRejected            |
    | 3   | BookingConfirmed | ConfirmBooking     | System      | Conflict detection fails -> BookingRejected  |
    | 4   | CheckInRecorded  | RecordCheckIn      | Employee    | Timeout without check-in -> BookingCancelled |

- **Hotspot annotations**: BookingConfirmed is a strong consistency point (concurrent competition for time slots).
- **Ambiguity**: Does "booking" mean a request or a confirmed reservation? Two-state distinction must be clarified.

### A.2 Stage II: Strategic Modeling

**`ddd-subdomains` (③)**

| Capability                       | Subdomain Type | Rationale                                                                           |
| :------------------------------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Booking & Conflict Management    | Core           | Core competitive advantage: precise time conflict detection and concurrency control |
| Meeting Room Resource Management | Supporting     | Necessary but non-differentiating                                                   |
| User Identity & Permissions      | Generic        | General-purpose capability, reusable from existing systems                          |

**`ddd-contexts` (④)**

| Context      | Responsibilities                                           | Core Terms                       | Ownership     |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------ |
| Booking      | Full booking lifecycle: request, confirm, cancel, check-in | Booking, TimeSlot, BookingPolicy | Booking Team  |
| Room Catalog | Room registration, capacity, equipment, availability       | Room, Capacity, Equipment        | Admin Team    |
| Identity     | User authentication and authorization                      | User, Role, Permission           | Platform Team |

- **Boundary ADR**: In the Booking context, Room is only a RoomId reference, not holding Room details; availability must be queried.
- **Glossary conflict resolution**: "Room" in Booking is RoomId (identifier), in Room Catalog it is a complete entity.

**`ddd-context-map` (⑤)**

| Upstream     | Downstream | Pattern                     | Description                                   |
| :----------- | :--------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Room Catalog | Booking    | OHS (Open Host Service)     | Booking queries available room list           |
| Identity     | Booking    | ACL (Anti-Corruption Layer) | Booking translates UserId into Booker concept |

- **Failure mode**: When Room Catalog is unavailable, Booking degrades to "only allowing bookings with known RoomIds."

### A.3 Stage III: Tactical Modeling

**`ddd-aggregates` (⑥)**

| Aggregate | Aggregate Root | Contains                          | Key Invariant                                                 |
| :-------- | :------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Booking   | Booking        | TimeSlot (VO), BookingStatus (VO) | The same Room and TimeSlot cannot have two Confirmed Bookings |
| Room      | Room           | Capacity (VO), Equipment (VO)     | Room must have a unique identifier and non-zero capacity      |

- **Transaction boundary**: Default is one transaction modifies one aggregate.
- **Cross-aggregate consistency**: Booking confirmation requires querying Room availability -> achieved through domain events + optimistic locking.

**`ddd-domain-interactions` (⑦)**

| Domain Event     | Source Aggregate | Trigger Condition        | Consumer                        | Idempotency Key     |
| :--------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------ |
| BookingConfirmed | Booking          | Conflict detection pass  | Notification service (external) | BookingId + Version |
| BookingCancelled | Booking          | Timeout without check-in | Room Catalog (release slot)     | BookingId           |

- **Repository interface**: `BookingRepository.findByRoomAndTimeSlot(roomId, timeSlot)` — for conflict detection.
- **Domain service**: `ConflictDetectionService` — cross-Booking aggregate check for same-slot occupancy.

### A.4 Stage IV: Model Validation

**`ddd-model-review` (⑧)**

| Dimension               | Score | Finding                                                                                                   |
| :---------------------- | :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Terminology consistency | 9/10  | "Room" cross-context meaning clearly distinguished                                                        |
| Aggregate boundaries    | 7/10  | ConflictDetectionService requires cross-aggregate query -> evaluate whether boundary adjustment is needed |
| Event completeness      | 8/10  | Missing formal definition for BookingRejected event                                                       |

- **Backtrack trigger**: Aggregate score 7/10 -> recommend returning to ⑥ `ddd-aggregates` to evaluate whether TimeSlot availability should be promoted to an independent aggregate (RoomSchedule) to eliminate cross-aggregate queries.

### A.5 Feedback Loop Example

The above review triggers backtracking to ⑥ `ddd-aggregates`:

- **Adjustment**: Introduce a `RoomSchedule` aggregate, holding all time slot occupancy states for a given Room.
- **New invariant**: Within RoomSchedule, the same TimeSlot allows only one Confirmed occupancy.
- **Impact**: ConflictDetectionService is eliminated; conflict detection is internalized as a RoomSchedule aggregate invariant.
- **Re-validation**: Aggregate score improves to 9/10, no new backtrack triggers.

The following matrix codifies issues that may be discovered during each skill's execution into actionable backtrack rules, avoiding inconsistency from experience-based judgment:

| Detecting Skill             | Trigger Condition                                                        | Backtrack To | Skill(s) to Re-Execute            | Explanation                                                    |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⑧ `ddd-model-review`        | Aggregate boundaries contradict context boundaries                       | Stage II     | `ddd-contexts`                    | Contexts need re-partitioning for consistency                  |
| ⑧ `ddd-model-review`        | Terminology conflict rate > 20%                                          | Stage II     | `ddd-contexts`                    | Ubiquitous Language definitions insufficient                   |
| ⑧ `ddd-model-review`        | Invariant expression rate < 60% (aggregates lack explicit invariants)    | Stage III    | `ddd-aggregates`                  | Aggregates may be data containers, not behavioral boundaries   |
| ⑧ `ddd-model-review`        | Integration patterns inconsistent with context mapping                   | Stage II     | `ddd-context-map`                 | Tactical layer discovered new integration needs                |
| ⑧ `ddd-model-review`        | Event completeness < 70% (event directory incomplete)                    | Stage III    | `ddd-domain-interactions`         | Event directory missing critical flows                         |
| ⑦ `ddd-domain-interactions` | Events need to carry another aggregate's private data                    | Stage III    | `ddd-aggregates`                  | Aggregate boundaries need adjustment for self-contained events |
| ⑥ `ddd-aggregates`          | Invariants span multiple contexts                                        | Stage II     | `ddd-contexts`                    | Consistency requirements fragmented by boundaries              |
| ⑤ `ddd-context-map`         | Circular dependencies or single context bears > 3 upstream relationships | Stage II     | `ddd-subdomains` / `ddd-contexts` | Possible "god context" or subdomain misclassification          |
| ④ `ddd-contexts`            | > 5 terms have irreconcilable cross-context conflicts                    | Stage I      | `ddd-discover`                    | Domain understanding insufficient                              |
| ③ `ddd-subdomains`          | Cannot distinguish Core from Supporting (no differentiating capability)  | Stage I      | `ddd-scope`                       | Business value proposition unclear                             |

> **Infinite loop prevention**: The same backtrack path may be executed at most 3 times. If triggered a 3rd time, escalate to `ddd-scope` for business goal realignment, or flag as "architectural decision requiring human intervention."
