Count is 40 data sources. System Metadatabase lists 36. Folder `70-extras/` holds the other four. Time Tracker appears in the Metadatabase ERD as a Task relation, not as a standalone data source. The Google Drive File relation on Tasks returned `object_not_found`.

Knowledge Base Topics and CS Topics share the live title `Topics`. Use the Object column in this table, then the `collection://` ID in `03-identifiers.md`.

Lookup order:

1. Open `02-master-catalog.md` and pick the Object row.
2. Open the Doc path in that row.
3. Copy IDs from `03-identifiers.md`.
